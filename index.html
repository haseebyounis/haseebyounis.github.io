          <h1>"Iron" Mike<br>Tyson</h1>
          <h2>The <span class="mark-block">most devastating</span> &nbsp;puncher in boxing history.</h2>
          <p>"Iron" Mike Tyson (born June 30, 1966) reigned as the undisputed world heavyweight champion and holds the record as the youngest boxer to win a heavyweight title, at 20 years, four months, and 22 days old. Tyson won his first 19 professional fights by knockout, 12 of them in the first round.</p>
          <p>Mike Tyson is remembered as one of the most feared fighters of all time, a force of nature, a natural specimen with a 20.5" neck at 5'10" and weighed 215 lbs who at 20 became the youngest heavyweight champion in history.</p>

      <p>He ran through the heavyweight division unlike anyone before him and anyone since him. </p>

      <p>He is the youngest man to win the heavyweight title and was just as likely to commit a foul against you then he was to knock you out.</p>

      <p>Only six opponents saw the final bell against him and he was involved in some of the most bizarre incidents the ring has ever seen..</p>
     
     <p>He won his first 19 fights by knockout and has 23 first round knockouts. He has knockouts in 49, 38, 30, 50, 54, 37, and two in 39 seconds.</p>

     <p>He also broke the jaw of Razor Ruddock but was involved in just as many bizarre incidents. His fight with Orlin Norris was ruled a no contest after he hurt his knee when Tyson hit him with a late punch.</p>

     <p>He continued to punch Lou Savarese after the fight was called and knocked down referee John Coyle in the process. He also tried to break the arm of Francois Botha when the two were tied up.</p>

     <p>We all know what happened when Evander Holyfield wouldn’t stop head butting him in their second fight. In the most bizarre boxing incident in my lifetime Tyson bit part of Holyfield’s ear off.</p>

     <p>Tyson was one of the most dangerous men ever to step into the ring regardless of weight class. He could knock you out or go out of his mind and bite you or try to break your arm.</p>

     <p>That is why he is the most dangerous heavyweight fighter ever to step into the ring.</p>
